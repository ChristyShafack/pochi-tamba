              p My name is Pochi. Some friends call me Porsche. In another life, I worked as a broadcaster 
                br
                | and communication consultant for projects and organisations for 20years. But throughout 
                br
                | my life, my passion has been people, and empowering voices for change. This space is about 
                br

              h2 My multi-faceted background

              p For twenty years, I worked as a broadcaster, a producer and as communication consultant
                br 
                | for projects and organizations in Africa, Asia and the USA. But besides this exhilarating job, 
                br 
                | my passion has always been people. To build and keep energized the humans behind each 
                br
                | concept. It is probably a passion that grew out of my intense civil society life.

              p  
                | In 2006, I joined a group of handpicked youths around the world to represent Africa in writing
                br 
                | a toolkit for youths in sustainable development called â€œNothing for Us without Us". It still is  
                br
                | being used to coach youths today. The project was sponsored by UK based charity focusing
                br
                | on youth entrepreneurship, employability, sustainable development and youth empowerment

              p
                | In 2007, I started a pan African network that grew to have members in 40 African counties and 
                br
                | today has an ECOSOC status with the UN and promotes the concept of youth-led development.

              p 
                | In 2008 I started Maya Initiatives. With this organisation, I have worked with victims of sexual,
                br
                | assault communities and partner organisations in Cameroon and abroad to fight stigma around
                br
                | rape and encourage communication around sexual violence and support for survivors and families.

              p
                | When I look at my multi-faceted life, one thread holds it all. The passion to speak for the 
                br
                | unheard or the silenced. And further to that, a stronger passion to build awareness about 
                br
                | the voices we wield and story they tell about us. So that we know and be in control.
